I'm Deniz, an AWS Community Builder and Content Creator with 7 active AWS certifications, specializing in making cloud technology accessible through practical, hands-on content.

## AWS Community Builder
As an AWS Community Builder, I'm part of a select program that supports technical enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing AWS knowledge. The program provides mentorship, technical resources, and networking opportunities to help amplify community voices. You can find my profile in the [AWS Community Builders Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=*all&awsf.location=*all&awsf.year=*all&cb-cards.q=Deniz%2BYilmaz&cb-cards.q_operator=AND){:target="_blank"}

## What I Create
My heads in the cloud, splitting my time between:

- `QA (Formerly Cloud Academy)` - My full-time role where I create professional AWS educational content reaching 10,000+ learners â†’ All my lessons on the [QA Learning Platform](https://docs.digitalden.cloud/tags/qa-learning-platform/){:target="_blank"} are tagged.
- `Hands-On with Digital Den (YouTube)` - My passion project that I develop outside working hours, creating AWS solutions and lessons for over 1,000 subscribers with 25K+ monthly views

## Certifications
I have achieved 7 AWS Certification, and while I aim to pass all 12 eventually, I don't want to rush the process. I believe in taking time to build real-world solutions between certifications. Otherwise, where's the fun in that?

I highly recommend [AWS Cloud Quest](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/){:target="_blank"} to anyone looking to build hands-on skills across various AWS topics. It's a fun way to gaining practical experience before sitting exams.

## Quantum Physics Interest
I'm quite compelled by theoretical physics because it explores what we're truly made of at the most fundamental level. I enjoy learning about why particles behave the way they do and how the building blocks of our universe operate under different rules than our everyday experience. In my free time I like to attend lectures at the Royal Institution to learn more about these concepts.

> AWS offers **Amazon Braket**, a service that lets you experiment with quantum computing in the cloud. With access to multiple quantum hardware providers, you can explore quantum algorithms and applications without needing specialized equipment.

## About This Site  
This site is built using **Jekyll**, a static site generator with the **Chirpy** theme. It's configured with **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment to **GitHub Pages** whenever changes are pushed, making it live at `docs.digitalden.cloud` through a custom domain. The open-source code is available for you to view on [GitHub](https://github.com/digitalden3/digitalden3.github.io){:target="_blank"}. You can also learn how to set it up step-by-step by following [the documentation](https://docs.digitalden.cloud/posts/set-up-and-deploy-a-documentation-site-with-jekyll-and-chirpy-on-aws-cloud9/){:target="_blank"}.  

## Personal Site
You can also check out my personal site [digitalden.cloud](https://digitalden.cloud/){:target="_blank"}, which is based on the HTML5UP Dimensions site template integrated with particles.js for the dynamic particle effect. 

 The entire infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform on AWS. The site's static files are hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed globally via CloudFront for low-latency access. DNS and SSL are handled by AWS Route 53 and Certificate Manager, ensuring a secure, custom domain. Deployment is fully automated through a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, with the codebase version-controlled on GitHub.
