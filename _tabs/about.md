**Hi, I'm Deniz!**  
I'm an AWS Community Builder and Content Creator with 6 active AWS certifications. I create content for `DigitalDenCloud` and my YouTube channel, [Hands-On with Digital Den](https://www.youtube.com/@digitaldencloud){:target="_blank"}, is part of that initiative.

My channel features:

- Hands-on AWS projects and tutorials  
- Integrations of various cloud services  
- Real-world applications of cloud technologies  
- Focused, no-nonsense technical content  
 
My content is dedicated to teaching practical implementations of AWS services and showcasing creative cloud solutions. You will find step-by-step guides on topics on a range of services including emerging technologies like Generative AI.

### Professional Role  
As an AWS Content Creator at `DigitalDenCloud` and `QA` (Formerly Cloud Academy), I design, develop, and refine AWS content. My work covers a broad spectrum of AWS technologies, helping learners effectively implement and configure these services. All my QA lessons are tagged and can be found [QA Lessons](https://docs.digitalden.cloud/categories/qa-lessons/){:target="_blank"}.

### Outside the Cloud  

When I'm not in the cloud, I enjoy maintaining an active lifestyle â€” playing football for a Sunday League team, playing tennis, and cycling.

 I also enjoy learning about quantum physics and attend lectures on the topic at the [Royal Institution](https://www.rigb.org){:target="_blank"}.

> AWS offers **Amazon Braket**, a service that lets you experiment with quantum computing in the cloud. With access to multiple quantum hardware providers, you can explore quantum algorithms and applications without needing specialized equipment.
