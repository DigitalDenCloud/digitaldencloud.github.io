By the end of this post, you'll have a powerful, GPU-accelerated AWS environment optimized for Adobe Creative Cloud workflows, tailored to your preferred setup method. A complementary video tutorial is also provided for a more comprehensive learning experience.

## Checking and Increasing AWS Service Quotas
We're selecting the [g4dn.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/){:target="_blank"} instance for our AWS EC2 setup.

| Instance Size                | GPU      | vCPU    | RAM    | On-Demand Price/hr* |
| :--------------------------- | :------- | :------ | :----- | :------------------ |
| g4dn.2xlarge                 | 1        | 8       | 16GB   | $0.752              |


The g4dn.2xlarge has a good balance of graphics performance and cost-efficiency. The included NVIDIA GPU is efficient for After Effects, enabling robust rendering capabilities. With sufficient compute and memory resources, it can handle complex tasks and large projects effectively.

Before we launch the g4dn.2xlarge instance for the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, ensure that your AWS account service quotas support your needs. AWS imposes default service quotas to manage resource allocation. If you haven't used GPU instances before, you may need to request an increase for specific quotas for GPU instance instances.

- In the [Service Quotas Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home){:target="_blank"} use the search function to find quotas associated with EC2 services. Ensure you're in the region where you want to deploy the GPU instances.
- Search for and select the quota **"Running On-Demand G and VT instances".**

If you see that your quota is 8 or higher, you're ready to proceed with the instance launch. If your quota is anything less, you'll need to request an increase. 
- Click on **"Request increase at the account level"** and specify an increase from 0 to at least 8 vCPUs. This adjustment is required to meet the minimum vCPU requirement for launching g4dn.2xlarge instances. 

> When you submit your quota increase request, AWS will review it, which typically takes a few days. AWS will then inform you via email once your quota increase request has been processed.
