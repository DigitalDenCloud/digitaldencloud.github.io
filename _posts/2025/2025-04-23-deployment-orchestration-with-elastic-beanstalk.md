In this lesson, you will learn about the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service and how it can be used to help you deploy and scale your applications and services with ease and without you having to worry about provisioning components and implementing high availability features such as elastic load balancing and auto-scaling. All of this and more is managed and handled by Elastic Beanstalk, and this lesson is designed to take you through those features. 

The lesson is brought to you by Deniz Yilmaz, an AWS content creator at QA. Feel free to contact Deniz using deniz.yilmaz@qa.com. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at QA by sending an e-mail to platformsupport@qa.com, where one of our cloud experts will reply to your question.  

## Intended audience  
This lesson is intended for developers, and DevOps engineers, looking to automate the process of deploying, scaling, and managing applications on AWS. 

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll be able to:  
- Understand the fundamentals of AWS Elastic Beanstalk and its key components. 
- Distinguish between different environment tiers and their use cases. 
- Apply design considerations for scalability, security, and persistent storage. 
- Choose appropriate deployment strategies for your application (such as rolling, immutable, or blue-green). 
- Monitor and manage environment health using basic and enhanced health reporting 
- Deploy a Python Flask application using the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface (CLI) from AWS CloudShell, a browser-based shell. 

This hands-on demonstration will show you how to deploy directly from the command line while Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the infrastructure provisioning and management. 

## Prerequisites  
To gain the most from this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of AWS services and core cloud concepts, and some prior exposure to the AWS Command Line Interface, although this is not strictly required.
