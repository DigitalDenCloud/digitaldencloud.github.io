Build cloud architectures that are efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally conscious. Through 4 lessons, 1 lab, and 1 hands-on demo, this course will show you how to optimize AWS storage and database services with the right configurations and automation, helping you reduce costs, improve performance, and support long-term sustainability.

## Intended Audience
This course is designed for cloud engineers, architects, database administrators, and DevOps professionals who want to optimize AWS storage and databases for cost, performance, and sustainability.

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be able to:  
- Choose the right S3 storage classes with lifecycle policies
- Choose the right EBS volume type and manage snapshots efficiently
- Compare cost and performance across RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, and Redshift
- Apply efficient data management practices with AWS Glue and Athena

## Hands-On Demo
This course includes a practical demo that shows how to automatically clean up orphaned Amazon EBS volumes using AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager. Orphaned volumes often remain after EC2 instances are terminated, generating unnecessary storage costs if not addressed.

In the demo, you will see how to:
- Use AWS Config to continuously evaluate your environment and identify unused EBS volumes
- Automatically trigger an action when an orphaned volume is detected
- Create an EBS snapshot to back up the data before deletion
- Use Systems Manager Automation to remove the orphaned volume safely and consistently

This process ensures that your environment stays optimized, storage costs are reduced, and your infrastructure remains aligned with both cost efficiency and sustainability best practices.
