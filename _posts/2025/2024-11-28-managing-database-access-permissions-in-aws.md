In this lesson, you will learn how to secure and manage database access using various authentication mechanisms, access control practices, encryption methods, and monitoring tools provided by AWS. 

## Learning Objectives
- Implement secure database access using password-based, certificate-based, and role-based authentication
- Configure access control and network security using IAM policies, VPC security groups, and subnets
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions for precise access management
- Encrypt database data at rest and in transit using AWS encryption options and SSL/TLS connections
- Monitor and audit database activity using AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, and Database Activity Streams to ensure compliance and detect unauthorized access

## Intended Audience
This lesson is for cloud engineers, database administrators, DevOps professionals, and anyone preparing for the AWS Certified Data Engineering associate exam.

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this lesson, you should have some basic working knowledge of cloud computing concepts, AWS services, and database management. Experience with IAM policies, VPC configurations, and encryption practices in AWS is beneficial.
