In this lesson, you will learn about AWS Non-Relational Database services and how they can be used to store, retrieve, and manage various types of data without requiring a fixed schema. These purpose-built database services are designed to address specific use cases and workloads that traditional relational databases are not optimized to handle.

This lesson covers fundamental concepts of NoSQL databases, then examines the three primary NoSQL database types offered by AWS: key-value databases with Amazon DynamoDB, document databases with Amazon DocumentDB, and in-memory databases with Amazon ElastiCache.

While this lesson aims to provide you with a comprehensive overview of each database, it also explains their architecture and technical workings. You’ll also see hands-on demonstrations of how to implement and configure these services in real-world scenarios.
