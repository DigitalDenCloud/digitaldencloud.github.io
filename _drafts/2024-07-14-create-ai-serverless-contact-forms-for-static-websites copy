## Introduction
Static websites are popular for their speed, security, and cost-effectiveness. However, they lack the ability to handle dynamic operations like processing contact form submissions. In this blog post, we'll overcome this limitation by creating a serverless backend with generative AI capabilities for handling contact forms on static websites.

### The Challenge:
Traditional server-based solutions for contact form processing require 24/7 server provisioning and management, introducing complexity, expenses, and management overhead. This can undermine the simplicity and cost-effectiveness that make static sites attractive.

### The Solution:
We'll implement a serverless approach using AWS services to handle contact form submissions. This solution offers several advantages:
- Pay only for the compute time used to process form submissions
- Automatic scaling to handle varying loads
- No server infrastructure management required
- Easy integration with any static website, regardless of hosting platform

### Integrating Generative AI:
You might be wondering why we're integrating generative AI into the contact form solution. Let's explore this:
1. Many websites offer generic, pre-written responses to form submissions, which can feel impersonal. Incorporating generative AI into the contact form creates a unique experience for each user, potentially leaving them with a lasting impression.
2. Integrating generative AI with serverless architecture demonstrates a practical application of emerging technologies in a common web feature, illustrating how advanced solutions can enhance routine online interactions such as submitting contact forms.

### Objectives:
By the end of this post, you'll be able to:
1. Create a serverless backend for handling contact form submissions
2. Integrate Generative AI features into a serverless backend
3. Implement automated email functionality
4. Integrate a serverless backend with a contact form of a static website

### Prerequisites:
Before we begin, you'll need the following:

1. An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage the required services.
2. A registered domain name to set up Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).
3. Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension installed (for local testing of your static website).

> Note: 
- Amazon Route 53 is recommended for easier DNS configuration. While you can use any domain registrar, domains not managed by Route 53 will require additional steps for SES verification.
- A pre-existing static website is not required for this tutorial. We'll use the HTML5 UP Dimensions template, which includes a built-in contact form.

### Solution Architecture:

Here's how the solution works:

1. A visitor submits the static contact form on your website.
2. The form sends an HTTP POST request to Amazon API Gateway.
3. API Gateway receives the request and invokes an AWS Lambda function.
4. The Lambda function:
  - Processes the form data
  - Contains a pre-defined prompt for inspirational quote generation
  - Invokes the Bedrock API with this prompt
5. Amazon Bedrock processes the prompt and generates a unique inspirational quote.
6. The Lambda function receives the response from Bedrock and initiates the email-sending process using Amazon SES.
7. Amazon SES handles the email delivery:
  - Sends a notification email to you, the website owner
  - Sends a confirmation email, including the inspirational quote, to the website visitor

This serverless solution manages the entire form submission, quote generation, and email delivery without traditional server management, seamlessly integrating dynamic functionality with static websites.

### Frontend Integration:
For our static website frontend, we'll use the HTML5 UP Dimensions Template, which provides a clean, modern design that's easy to set up and customize. We'll modify the template's contact form to interact with our serverless backend by:

1. Updating the form's action to point to our API Gateway endpoint URL.
2. Adding custom JavaScript to:
   - Capture form data when a user submits the contact form
   - Send this data as a POST request to API Gateway
   - Use HTML5 validation for required fields, email format, and message length
   - Manage the user experience by displaying success or error messages based on the API response

We'll test the modified frontend locally using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension. This approach allows us to interact with the contact form and verify its connection to the serverless backend without needing to deploy a static website or connect a domain.

Let's build it!

## Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
In this section, we set up Amazon SES to handle email communications for our serverless contact form. By the end of this section, you will have a fully configured Amazon SES setup that enables your serverless backend to automatically send emails to anyone who fills out your contact form and notify you, the website owner, about new submissions.
